# Node

Node-red is used as a basic REST server.  A couple of test flows were developed to listen on a URL and return a static quote payload.  The payload of the services are not important.

1. Install node-red
2. Upload the 2 .json files.
3. run the flows with the command: node-red ./blue-green.json
